### Post from Blog Editors

You can use your favorite blog editors including [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) (Mac), [Live Writer](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer) (PC), and others to post and edit entries on your Alkaline-powered Web site.

###### 1. Check compatibility.

Most, but not all, Web hosting providers supply you with the [PHP XML-RPC module](http://us3.php.net/xmlrpc) necessary for Alkaline to communicate with your blog editor. Check your compatibility suite (`cs.php`, and also available for [download](/compatibility/)) to ensure you have the module installed.

###### 2. Set up your blog editor.

Download and install a MetaWeblog-compliant blog editor such as one of those mentioned above. Next, set up your blog editor by adding a blog to it. When asked to choose your publishing platform, choose "Alkaline," "Blogger-compliant," "MetaWeblog-compliant," "other," or a similar option. Next it'll ask for an access point or URI/URL, which is:

	http://www.your_domain.com/your_base/admin/xmlrpc.php

Supply the same username and password you use to log-in to your Alkaline Dashboard.

###### 3. Begin posting and editing.

You're all good to go. Your changes will be reflected instantly on your Web site, so be sure to "Save as Draft" or your posts will go live to the world.
